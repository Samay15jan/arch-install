Basically just bunch of scripts.

### Features

- **Automated Installation**: Prompt based easy and quick installation of arch linux.

- **Lightweight Linux Environment**: Utilizes just 300Mib at ideal system with the help of i3wm and custom configuration files.

- **Bootable ISO Image**: Find pre-built HeimOS ISO images in the [Releases](https://github.com/samay15jan/heimos/releases) section for a fast and easy installation experience.


### Usage

1. Download the HeimOS ISO from the [Releases](https://github.com/samay15jan/heimos/releases) section.
2. Create a bootable USB or use a virtual machine to boot from the ISO.
3. Follow on-screen prompts for basic configuration.
4. Relax as HeimOS handles the entire installation process.


### Post-Installation Customization

If you prefer to have a graphical interface with all my lightweight configurations and customizations then run:
```bash
./arch_install3.sh
```

### Todo

1. Explore GUI Installers: Integrating Calamares or another GUI installer for a user-friendly installation experience.
2. Modularize Scripts: Break down the scripts into modular components for easier maintenance and customization.
3. Rebranding: Rebrand the to installed system to HeimOS with custom logos, boot menus, etc.


### Note 

This Install will wipe everything you have on your system. So, am not responsible for any sort data loss while installation. 
I recommend checking the scripts before installation.

Edit: ChatGPT is really good at generating readme :)
